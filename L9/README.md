## Lesson 9: Spam Classifier
In this project we want to identify spam email as correctly and 
accurately as possible. We can measure the types of words that 
appear in sample emails and determine from that whether or not
they are spam.

We use **Bayes' Theorem** to find the probability that an 
email is spam given the words contained in that email.

TODO:
1. Find many spam emails [maybe from here?](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00228)/
2. Generate the dictionary for spam, hams
3. Find the three probabilities required by Bayes.
