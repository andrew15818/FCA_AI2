# Project code for the FCA AI2 course

These are the projects for the AI2 course at First Code Academy.
The tentative list for projects include:

## Lesson 1: Optimal moves of a knight on a chessboard
Here, we use different searching algorithms to move a knight across a chessboard.
Given a start and an end position, we can find the optimal move for a knight, and
then mark the nodes along the optimal path.

The main idea is to compare different types of algorithms and when they would be 
better/worse than other ones.

## Lesson 2: Shortest paths

## Lesson 3: 8-Queens
In this lesson we learn about satisfiability and constraint satisfaction, which
will influence our agents when making decisions. 

The 8-queens (we could find a solution for n-queens on an nxn board) problem refers
to finding a valid configuration of 8 queens on a chessboard such that none of them
attack each other.

One such configuration is

where the configuration happens to be symmetrical.
