# Project code for the FCA AI2 course

These are the projects for the AI2 course at First Code Academy.
The tentative list for projects include:

## Lesson 1: Optimal moves of a knight on a chessboard
Here, we use different searching algorithms to move a knight across a chessboard.
Given a start and an end position, we can find the optimal move for a knight, and
then mark the nodes along the optimal path.

The main idea is to compare different types of algorithms and when they would be 
better/worse than other ones.
