# Lesson 2 Project: Shortest Paths

Since in the lesson we covered graphs and matrices, my main
idea here was to have the students better see how they can
be used in practice. Also, it would be good for students
to find out how grpahs are used in code, since they may be
a bit abstract when seen in the classroom.

One of the more famous examples of problems in graph theory
is that of **shortest problems**. In this problem, we want 
to find the shortest path between either one node and
another single node. 

We could also modify the problem to find the shortest node
between one node and all the other nodes in our graph, or
to find the distance between every pair of nodes as well.

To run the program, we can just use 

```python
python L2.py
```
