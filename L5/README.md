## Lesson 5: Curve Fitting
Curve Fitting, or finding the best line to describe a
pattern of data, is one of the most common problems 
in modern AI/Data Science. In this lesson, we touched
on the main idea behind trying to find the good function. 

For this project, we provide the students with a set of
(x, y) points and the objective is to find a linear 
function that minimizes the error between the function 
and the data points.

For this project, we need `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
If they are not present on the computer, then we can install 
them using the commands 

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```
