# Lesson 1 Project: Find optimal number of moves of knight on a chessboard

## Problem Description

Suppose we are given a h x w sized chessboard, and we are given the starting 
position of a knight on the chessboard. If we are given the location we want
the knight to end up in, we need to find the smallest amount of moves that
will get us from start to end.

We can try out different algorithms to see which one is the best, although 
this might be too much for one lesson.

## General approach 
I would like to compare/contrast different approaches to searching for a solution
using some of the methods we learned from AC260.

I was thinking of having the students fill out the code for the main algorithms
and choosing one via a message.

What are the steps we need to solve the problem? Below are my thougths of 
how the program should flow:
1. Clear the board.
2. Ask the user for starting and ending coordinates.
3. Draw the board with a symbol in the knight's starting position. 
4. Use the algorithm to find the best path.
5. Draw the board after having the algorithm applied to it. Maybe have the order
in which the nodes are explored.
