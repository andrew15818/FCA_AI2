# FCA Artificial Inteligence Starter Files
In the main repo, we have the completed files for each individual project.
Here are the starter files that the students will receive. 

After going through the material in the lessons, we have a small project
to tie up the class. In these projects, we usually give the students some
small file to fill in.
